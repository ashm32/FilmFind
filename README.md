# FilmFind
Film Find is a website to provide contemporaneous context for movies a user plans to watch.

The application meets the following requirements:
- Uses a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Building an interactive and responsive webpage.
- Uses at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Uses client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Have a polished UI.

A user can search for a film and the application will load the youtube video with a poster and details of the film. The application will also provide wiki links which the user can explore. The user must be logged in to be able to add the movie to their watchlist (this is yet to be implemented). The bottom section of the page highlights the teams top 6 movie recommendations which are updated monthly manually.
